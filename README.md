### Hey ðŸ‘‹ !

Thank you for checking out my Github page. I have a page set up as well where it's a little easier to look at a glance at some of the projects that I've been working on. You can find that [here](https://jt5301.github.io/).

Thank you again for stopping by! Please feel free to reach out. It'd be great to meet you and say hello ðŸŒ±
